All of my mods are open source and located on my [url=https://github.com/Shadow32055]GitHub[/url]. I just ask that before you release anything with substantial similarities, you message me for approval. Feel free to "borrow" any code for whatever you need (with credit). Be sure to also follow the license and release anything as open source as well, that way the modding community can grow!
