[size=6][b]FAQ[/b][/size]
[b] I have 100+ mods installed and your mod is causing a crash![/b]
Nothing I can do about it, I'm not going to install 100+ mods to debug [i]your[/i] issue, you narrow it down to the mods in question and I'll be much more inclined to take a look.

[b]I encountered an issue, what should I do?[/b]
Post the information in the correct mod channel on [url=https://discord.gg/yMAVqcwcZQ]Discord[/url]. The more information (screenshot, logs, reports, actions, etc.) provided the easier and faster it will be to resolve the issue.

[b]Is it save game compatible?[/b]
Yes, it can safely be added to an ongoing save game. It should be safe to remove from a save, but you should always backup your save before attempting any game/save modification.

[b]Are you going to update to x.x.x version?[/b]
Maybe, it really depends if I am actively working on Bannerlord modding or not. I try to make a conscious effort to update for every version but sometimes life happens.

[b]Can you add this new feature?[/b]
Maybe, it depends on if it's possible and if I am actively working on modding. Can't hurt to post the suggestion on the community [url=https://discord.gg/yMAVqcwcZQ]Discord[/url] server.

[b]Why is the bugs tab disabled?[/b]
It is too hard/time consuming to manage all the bug sections on my mods.

[b]I commented/sent you a PM, why have you not responded?[/b]
I have a life too, if you need something your best chance at getting my attention is through the community [url=https://discord.gg/yMAVqcwcZQ]Discord[/url] server. Please avoid messaging me directly on discord with questions my amazing discord community can help with.

[b]Are your mods open source?[/b]
Yes! All of my mods are open source and located on my [url=https://github.com/Shadow32055]GitHub[/url]. I just ask that before you release anything with substantial similarities, you message me for approval. Feel free to "borrow" any code for whatever you need (with credit). Be sure to also follow the license and release anything as open source as well, that way the modding community can grow!
